# SpeechRecognition
During my first year of my MSc I attended the Data Science Lab course, made up of theoretical lectures and practical lab sessions that served the scope of empowering me and my fellow students to get a first glimpse of both the complexity and the beauty of the Data Science Pipeline. 

In this context, I had the chance to experiment the notions learned during the lectures to carry out on my own a Speech Recognition task. At the end of this specific Lab, the TAs asked us to volontaurly write down a paper in the standard IEEE format to document the process we carried out, our intuitions and the approach we followed. 

This paper is presented in the Release to this repo. Feel free to read it and give me feedbacks if you wish so!
